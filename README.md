# Novel Navigator 

Turn Your Favorite Images into Book Recommendations

I'm thrilled to announce the launch of an app that I've been working on called "Novel Navigator". As a book lover myself, I wanted to create a tool that would help readers discover new books in a unique and fun way.

You simply upload an image and find the perfect book based on your visual inspiration

## Running the Application


To start the development server and run the portfolio website locally, use the following command:

bashCopy code

`npm start`

This command will compile the React code and launch a development server. Once the server is running, you can access the website by opening your web browser and navigating to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## Building for Production


To build the optimized and minified production version of the website, use the following command:

bashCopy code

`npm run build`

This command will generate a `build` directory with all the necessary files for deployment. You can then host the contents of this directory on any static web hosting platform.


## Deployment


Push to master and it will auto deploy to Firebase.
